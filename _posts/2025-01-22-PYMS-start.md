title: "PYMS is back"
---
PYMS has been inactive for several months, but it is now back with a renewed board. Since late 2024, four new early-career researchers (ECRs) have joined the team to carry the torch: Sajedeh Rasti (Eindhoven University), Raphael Merz (Ruhr University Bochum), Anouk Bouma, and Cas Goos (both from Tilburg University). Like the previous board, the new board aims to foster a vibrant community for meta-science ECRs through informal networking opportunities.

As one of the first steps, PYMS is placing greater emphasis on expanding its boundaries beyond the Netherlands to create a more inclusive and global community. Efforts are being made to encourage participation from international early-career researchers (ECRs) by fostering connections across institutions and countries. This approach aims to bring together a diverse range of perspectives and expertise, enabling richer collaborations and addressing challenges in meta-science from a broader, more global standpoint. By welcoming members from around the world, PYMS hopes to build a truly international platform for advancing meta-science.
