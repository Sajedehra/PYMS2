            The most recent PYMS meeting was organized as a precursor to the Dutch Reproducibility Network Symposium. 
            We get to hear amazing work of metascientists from broad range of backgrounds psychological science, computational sciences, sports and exercise science, and nanobioscience. We also had the opportunity of having Tracey Weissgerber as a keynote speaker to talk about having a career in meta-science.
